# A Novel Sparsity-based Deterministic Method for Shapley Value Approximation, with Applications
## Overview
This repository introduces a novel deterministic method for approximating Shapley values using QR decomposition and compressed sensing, specifically tailored for data valuation tasks. The Shapley value, a key concept from cooperative game theory, provides a fair distribution of payoffs based on individual contributions, making it essential for evaluating the worth of data assets.

## Key Features
- **Deterministic Approach:** Unlike traditional sampling methods, our technique guarantees consistent and reproducible results, enhancing the reliability of data valuation.
- **QR Decomposition Integration:** Utilizes QR decomposition to efficiently decompose the data matrix, streamlining the computation of Shapley values while maintaining accuracy.
- **Compressed Sensing Techniques:** Leverages compressed sensing to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets, enabling faster computations without significant loss of information.
- **Versatile Applications:** Suitable for various domains, including finance, marketing, and machine learning, where understanding data contributions is crucial.
